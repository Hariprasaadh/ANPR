# ANPR

Problem: Given an image of a vehicle, automatically locate the license plate and read its text.

Code: A compact, self-contained Jupyter Notebook implementing an end-to-end ANPR pipeline—detects the plate, preprocesses it, and extracts text with OCR—on sample or custom images.

How to run: Open and execute the cells in [ANPR.ipynb](https://github.com/Hariprasaadh/ANPR/blob/main/ANPR.ipynb) (locally or in Colab). Put test images in the [Images/](https://github.com/Hariprasaadh/ANPR/tree/main/Images) folder or update the paths in the notebook.

Output: The detected plate region and the extracted plate number text.
